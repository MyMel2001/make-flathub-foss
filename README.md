# Make FlatHub FOSS. <img align="right" src="flat-gnu.png"></img

## What does it do?

Strips out any proprietary flatpaks from your system and prevents installation of new ones
from FlatHub. :-)

## Why did you make this?

Because I wanted help making my system FOSS-only (except drivers), and I mostly use flatpaks.

## Can't I just use Fedora's Flatpak Repo?

You could, but this is a bit more fun. Plus, Fedora's repos are always going to be at least a
few miliseconds behind at the very least and at the very most a day or two behind. This is
due to their method of packaging (which is basicly to mirror/rebuild any FOSS FlatHub images
IIRC, so you might as well use this tool for slightly more up-to-date software!)
